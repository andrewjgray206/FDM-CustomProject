# FDM-CustomProject
My first attempt at creating a UI for a custom DB. 
Here lies the code written to create a UI, allowing queries to be displayed on a DB i created. All done in PHP.  
The UI is based around a menu containing common queries for the context of the DB.  
This was written as part of my Custom Project, for COS20015 in Semester 2, 2018.

This repo doesn't contain the SQL Database or any of the work that was created and assessed at the time. This interface was pretty much trivial at the time, and is now just a fun project i may or may not work on. The SQL database and repor that this interface was based around are marked as part of the unit and will not be included in this repo.
