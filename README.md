# FDM-CustomProject
My first attempt at creating a UI for a custom DB. 
Here lies the code written to create a UI, allowing queries to be displayed on a DB i created. All done in PHP.  
The UI is based around a menu containing common queries for the context of the DB.  
This was written as part of my Custom Project, for COS20015 in Semester 2, 2018.
